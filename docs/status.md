# One Person Lab App Status

Owner: `one-person-lab-app`
Purpose: `app_status`
State: `active`
Machine boundary: Human-readable status. Use `contracts/` and release/test
artifacts for machine decisions.

## Current State

- GitHub repo: `gaofeng21cn/one-person-lab-app`.
- App product repo history policy: clean App-owned history only.
- Active shell: `aionui`.
- Active shell root: `shells/aionui` as an external checkout.
- Active shell source repo: `gaofeng21cn/opl-aion-shell`.
- App product profile: `contracts/app-product-profile.json`.
- Framework dependency: `gaofeng21cn/one-person-lab`.
- Local App repo path on the maintainer Mac:
  `/Users/gaofeng/workspace/one-person-lab-app`.
- Local shell repo path on the maintainer Mac:
  `/Users/gaofeng/workspace/opl-aion-shell`.

The App repo must not merge AionUI history into its default branch. AionUI
upstream-following work stays in `opl-aion-shell`; App product release and user
docs stay in `one-person-lab-app`.

The App product profile is the current owner for desktop session defaults and
user-facing product policy: Codex default model/reasoning, default visible
companion skills, first-run deferred maintenance behavior, and Settings
presentation keys. The active shell consumes the generated copy at the
`shell_contract.paths.product_profile_target` path declared in
`contracts/app-shell-adapter.json`; runtime truth, provider implementation, and
domain truth remain outside App ownership.

First-install policy is now contract-backed in
`contracts/app-product-profile.json` and
`contracts/app-first-run-test-matrix.json`: Full first-install reaches Core
ready from bundled runtime on a clean Mac without requiring CLT, Homebrew, Node,
or Git first; repo sync, module reconcile, CLT installation, and ecosystem
module updates are background maintenance. Companion skills installation is
also App/CLI-managed maintenance. After Core ready, the App continues CLT,
companion skills, and ecosystem module work as best-effort background
maintenance instead of blocking first launch. Standard packages prefer
App-managed bootstrap and maintenance and cannot use “install
Homebrew/Node/Git first” as the first-screen terminal state. CLT requests use
`xcode-select --install` and wait for user confirmation inside Apple's system
installer. `officecli`, MinerU, and `opl-meta-agent` are App/CLI-managed
ecosystem modules.

## Release State

Standard App release assets and updater metadata are App-owned and currently
macOS arm64-only. Full first-install assets remain explicitly separate from
standard updater metadata. The updater must not select assets whose names
include `Full`. Standard App updates download in the background and apply after
restart when ready; they do not block first-run Core ready. This follows the
Electron autoUpdater background-download and download-ready restart prompt
model. Full assets are GitHub Release first-install downloads and do not enter
updater metadata. GitHub Release uploads, standard DMG, Full DMG, GUI smoke,
and user tutorials are all App-owned. The Framework repo is only a
runtime/CLI/contracts payload source for Full DMG and a machine-interface
provider for the App.

Current release validation is App-root first: root wrappers call the active shell
build/release scripts, then the produced standard package can replace
`/Applications/One Person Lab.app` for a real local GUI startup smoke.

Runtime page evidence path is declared in
`contracts/app-page-state-matrix.json`: the active shell loads the summary read
model through `opl runtime app-operator-drilldown --json`, lazy-loads full detail
through `opl runtime app-operator-drilldown --detail full --json`, and exposes
only refs-only `opl runtime action execute --action <id> [--payload refs-only-json]
[--dry-run]` controls. Execution refreshes the App/operator projection so
receipt/count fields stay framework-owned.

2026-05-22 App release evidence collection now has an App-owned CLI wrapper:
`scripts/collect-release-evidence.ts` fills `runtime-snapshot.json`,
`drilldown-summary.json`, `drilldown-full.json`, `action-dry-run-result.json`,
and, when explicitly requested, `action-execute-result.json` by calling the live
OPL CLI. It then writes `evidence-manifest.json` through the existing manifest
writer. Screenshot, clean first-run VM, settings smoke, and remote Release
verification artifacts remain required release evidence and stay marked
`missing` until real artifacts exist; the collector is a user-path evidence
bridge, not a packaged App release closeout.

2026-05-15 migration note: this local checkout is the clean App repo. It has no
tracked `shells/aionui` source, and local `shells/aionui` points to
`/Users/gaofeng/workspace/opl-aion-shell`. Remote migration keeps
`gaofeng21cn/opl-aion-shell` as the history-rich shell repo and uses
`gaofeng21cn/one-person-lab-app` as the clean App product repo.

2026-05-17 release note: the stable release channel is narrowed to macOS arm64
standard update assets plus separate macOS arm64 Full first-install assets.
Docker/WebUI compatibility remains a validation lane, not a desktop release
asset lane.

## Validation Entry Points

```bash
npm run ensure:shell
bun install --cwd shells/aionui --frozen-lockfile
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/validate-active-shell.ts --quick
npm run test:release-boundary
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/validate-release-boundary.ts
bun run i18n:types
bun run test
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/prepare-release-assets.ts build-artifacts release-assets
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/validate-release.ts release-assets
```

Page-state and first-run expectations are declared in
`contracts/app-page-state-matrix.json` and
`contracts/app-first-run-test-matrix.json`.
Product defaults are declared in `contracts/app-product-profile.json`.
